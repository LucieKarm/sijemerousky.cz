# Face mask sewing for hospitals, social workers and carers
## in Brno and its greater area
	
Brno is currently lacking disposable face masks for nursing homes or social workers in the field. Until the supplies resume, we will sew, collect, disinfect, pack and distribute masks, where it is needed the most. If you are an field worker, social worker or work in the health services and you need a mask, [contact us](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScT2zbyMPZp4LBdd6X_dBT3eAm15iF6gO4dS5KwYaPchdvWbA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

**It is not in our capabilities to sew for individuals; the priority is given to the organisations that care for the people at risk. Thank you for your understanding.**

**Live:** Infoline is available daily 8-16 at (+420) 542 123 425.

**Live:** Do you want to sew, but lack the material? We will deliver it to you, please [let us know](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdjZqHkglV2Gdva7ELOEVB6H6uPRfy8BAUKaHk2O_XiOAZpKw/viewform?usp=sf_link).

[How to use and handle the masks?](https://scontent-prg1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/89870226_237727443933011_1964651537363894272_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&_nc_sid=b96e70&_nc_ohc=dVfo8V14Zp4AX8Dj61Y&_nc_ht=scontent-prg1-1.xx&oh=dbc6920533f1e772bf43a4f1ca86ea3f&oe=5E93B966)
- Attention, do not "sterilise" the masks in the microwave, they might start to burn!

## How should the mask look like?
- The fabric and cords have to be **100% cotton**, so we can disinfect and reuse them.
- You can sew a DIY mask e.g. following [these instructions](https://scontent-prg1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/89338814_217960132915445_6483116063725715456_n.jpg?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=vf-v5EtQTz4AX_k4fP8&_nc_ht=scontent-prg1-1.xx&oh=cfcd929189382f2a1b607b106683d07d&oe=5E95E462).
- There is no need to shrink the fabric in advance and the threads can also be polyester.
